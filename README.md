This is where my first WEB ART: Cafe Muller is housed! But not paying attention to file management when I first uploaded it resulted being a bit of a mess! I'll re-update the folder hierarchy later.
The domain seems expired. Please refer to my web tour video if you want to have a look :-) https://youtu.be/pwYG6pWZFAE?si=rxy-Qj631m_Oq1ZV
This is a stream-of-consciousness love story adapted from Caf√© Muller. I wanted to use interactive web art to express alienation that is even growing stronger today.

After all, technological trauma is like post-war trauma - isn't it?
